Spaces Xâ€™s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets. 
If SpaceX will reuse the first stage?
Train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each,
much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.
